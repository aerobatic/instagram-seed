# instagram-seed - Seed project for building an Aerobatic Instagram app

This project serves as a reasonable skeleton for building [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/) powered web apps on the [Aerobatic](http://www.aerobaticapp.com) platform. Fork this project and use it as a starting point for your own app.

In order to require users of the app to authenticate via the Instagram OAuth provider, you will need to create an Instagram Client in the [Instagram Developer Site](http://instagram.com/developer/clients/manage). Then setup your CLIENT ID and CLIENT SECRET in the Aerobatic app settings.

You can see the angular-seed app live at [http://instagram-seed.aerobaticapp.com](http://instagram-seed.aerobaticapp.com).
